# Landing page for my portfolio

Plan
====
* Have main page that shows pictures/gifs/iframes of projects I want to link to.
  * On hover have 50% opacity overlay cover the image with an option to view the live site or to view github for code
* Have a second page for contact information
* On main page have a link to my other portfolio site built with nextjs
* Have a banner with the frameworks I have experience in
* Have my logo somewhere on the site
* Keep it simple!
